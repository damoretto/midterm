#Problem 15: Prime Factorization
#• Create a Python function that finds and prints the prime factors of a given positive integer
#– Hint: The fundamental theorem of arithmetic (Euclid and Kamal al-Din al-Farisi) says that any integer has a unique set of prime integers that can be multiplied together to get that number
#• You can use any user interface that you like, but the user must be able to continuously supply different numbers to be factored
#• Make sure that you attempt to handle all/some error cases
